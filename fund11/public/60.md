# Group 60

## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of the Cardano ecosystem through the development of user-friendly, open-source platforms and tools that facilitate the creation, staking, and management of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and FTs (Fungible Tokens). These proposals aim to address the lack of accessible and extensible solutions for NFT and FT creators and users, as well as to improve the overall user experience (UX) within the Cardano network.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals:
- NFT (Non-Fungible Token)
- FT (Fungible Token)
- Open-source
- User-friendly
- Cardano ecosystem
- Staking platform
- Minting platform
- Payment gateway
- Wallet integration
- Community participation
- Accessibility

All proposals except for "Continue the Expansion of Tangent Protocol" focus on creating or improving open-source platforms for NFT and FT management within the Cardano ecosystem. The "Continue the Expansion of Tangent Protocol" proposal, while still related to the Cardano ecosystem, specifically seeks funding for the implementation of token farming pools, DAO governance, and NFT staking for non-Tangent Protocol NFT projects, which is a slightly different focus compared to the other proposals.
