## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement and promotion of Marlowe, a tool for developing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. The proposals focus on making Marlowe more accessible and user-friendly for both technical and non-technical users, expanding its use in the financial sector, and improving its functionality with features like real-time price feeds and autonomous execution.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals:
- Marlowe
- Smart Contracts
- Cardano Ecosystem
- User-Friendly
- Non-Technical Users
- Financial Sector
- Real-Time Price Feeds
- Autonomous Execution
- Workshops
- User Interface (UI) Design
- Banking and Financial Services

All proposals except "BlockMargin - Interest Rate Futures on Cardano" explicitly mention the goal of making Marlowe more accessible or user-friendly. The "BlockMargin" proposal, while it does leverage Marlowe, is more focused on a specific application within the financial sector—bringing the settlement of Interest Rate Derivatives onto the blockchain—rather than on the broader goal of enhancing Marlowe's accessibility or functionality.
