The main idea common across most of these proposals is the enhancement of the travel and hospitality experience through the integration of innovative technologies, with a particular emphasis on the use of blockchain and smart contracts to improve various aspects of the industry. These proposals aim to address issues such as seamless travel planning, inventory management, personalized travel experiences, real-world applications of NFTs, efficient hotel check-in processes, and loyalty reward systems.

Common keywords or concepts across the proposals include:
- Blockchain (specifically Cardano)
- Smart contracts
- Seamless travel planning
- Hotel booking and reservations
- Personalized travel experiences
- NFTs and gamification
- Contactless check-in

The proposal titled "Hike2NFT - NFT Hiking Scavenger Hunt" stands out as it does not directly address the travel planning or hotel booking processes but instead focuses on creating a real-world application for NFTs that encourages outdoor activity and connects with the blockchain. This proposal is unique in its approach to combining technology with physical activity and education.
