## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of the Cardano ecosystem through the development of tools and protocols that address interoperability, data reliability, and investment challenges. These proposals aim to improve the functionality, accessibility, and attractiveness of Cardano for users and investors by integrating cross-chain swaps, providing accurate data for native tokens, and developing specialized financial tools.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals:
- Cross-chain interoperability
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Native token data reliability
- Specialized financial tools
- User experience improvements (e.g., feeless transactions, automatic smart contracts)
- Investment in Cardano ecosystem

The proposal titled "Cardano's First Inheritance Protocol - GenWealth" does not contain one of the main ideas identified above, as it specifically addresses the issue of crypto inheritance rather than ecosystem enhancement through interoperability, data reliability, or financial tools.
