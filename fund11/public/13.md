# Group 13

## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem through the development of various libraries, modules, and frameworks to improve interoperability, efficiency, and user experience. These proposals aim to address specific technical challenges such as large WebAssembly bundle sizes, the lack of certain language-specific libraries, and the need for lightweight and diverse client implementations. They also seek to align with Cardano's functional style and incentivize decentralized file hosting.

Common keywords and concepts across these proposals include:
- Cardano blockchain
- Libraries and modules (in various programming languages like Rust, TypeScript, Perl, Elm, and Go)
- Off-chain transaction building
- Chain indexing
- Network layer and Ouroboros protocol
- Lightweight and in-browser nodes
- Interoperability
- Decentralized file hosting and incentives

The proposal titled "AdaStream - Decentralized File Hosting Incentivised via Ada Payments" stands out as it does not directly address the development of a library or module for Cardano but rather focuses on creating an incentive system for decentralized file hosting within the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal is more aligned with the application layer and user incentivization rather than the technical infrastructure enhancements that are the focus of the other proposals.
