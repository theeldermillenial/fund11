## Summary

The main idea common across most of these proposals is the enhancement of developer tools and frameworks to improve the Cardano development ecosystem. The proposals aim to address various challenges faced by developers, such as the complexity of the UTxO model, the need for better off-chain computation tools, difficulties in interacting with the Cardano node, and the handling of Cardano data serialization. They also focus on improving the development experience by providing better debugging tools, unit testing frameworks, and multiplatform support for Cardano smart contract development.

Common keywords or concepts across these proposals include:
- Developer tools and frameworks
- Cardano development ecosystem
- UTxO model
- Off-chain computation
- Cardano node interaction
- CBOR data serialization
- Debugging and unit testing
- Multiplatform support
- Smart contract development

The proposal titled "Helios unit testing framework with code-coverage statistics" does not explicitly mention the common challenges such as the UTxO model complexity or off-chain computation but focuses on the need for in-language unit testing, which is still related to improving the development experience. All other proposals directly address the identified main idea of enhancing developer tools and frameworks for the Cardano ecosystem.
