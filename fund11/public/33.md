## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of user engagement and the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem through innovative gaming experiences and blockchain integration. The proposals aim to address issues such as low user engagement, lack of fun and depth in gaming, and the need for more diverse use cases for blockchain technology within the gaming industry. They propose solutions that involve creating engaging gaming experiences, leveraging Web3 and NFTs, and providing platforms for community and skill development.

Common keywords and concepts across the proposals include:
- User engagement
- Gaming experiences
- Blockchain integration
- Cardano ecosystem
- NFTs and digital ownership
- Web3 potential
- Community building
- Skill improvement
- Accessibility and visibility

One proposal that does not contain the main idea of enhancing gaming experiences through blockchain is "Expanding the Cardano NFT ecosystem through Shopify," which focuses on integrating Cardano with Shopify to expand NFT use cases. This proposal stands out as it does not directly address gaming but rather the broader application of NFTs within an e-commerce platform.
