## Summary

The main idea common across most of these proposals is enhancing security and usability in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The proposals aim to address vulnerabilities, improve user experience, and facilitate wider adoption of blockchain technology and digital assets. 

Common keywords and concepts include:
- Security (vulnerability, private key theft, secure transactions)
- Usability (user-friendly, onboarding, ease of use)
- Wallets (hot wallets, hardware wallets, software wallets, multi-sig wallets)
- Integration (cross-chain, Web2-Web3)
- Adoption (accessibility, mainstream use, loyalty programs)

The proposal titled "Endubis Messenger Wallet" stands out as it focuses more on the usability and adoption side, emphasizing the need for an easier onboarding solution to make the technology less intimidating for new users, rather than directly addressing security concerns.
