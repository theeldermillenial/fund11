# Group 11

## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the need to improve the accessibility and ease of development on the Cardano blockchain. This includes providing educational resources, tools, and support for developers, especially those who are not native English speakers or those new to Cardano's smart contract languages. The proposals aim to address the steep learning curve and language barriers that developers face when entering the Cardano ecosystem.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals:
- Educational content
- Developer support
- Non-native English resources
- Smart contract languages (Haskell, Plutus, Marlowe, Aiken, Opshin)
- Accessibility and ease of development
- Community and collaboration
- Open-source development

The proposal titled "Hydra for collaborative copyright management, at scale" does not directly address the common theme of improving developer accessibility and education. Instead, it focuses on the application of the Hydra protocol for intellectual property management, which is a more specific use case within the Cardano ecosystem.
