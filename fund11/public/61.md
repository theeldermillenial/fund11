# Group 61

## Summary

The main idea common across most of these proposals is the empowerment and inclusion of African communities through blockchain and Web 3.0 technologies. These proposals aim to address various challenges such as educational gaps, financial exclusion, and the lack of skilled developers by leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform to create solutions tailored to local needs.

Keywords and concepts common across the proposals include:
- Empowerment
- Education
- Blockchain (specifically Cardano)
- Web 3.0
- Financial inclusion
- Local language resources
- Skill development
- Community impact

The proposals that do not fit this main idea are "PadiWash: On-demand mobile car care subscription service using AI and Cardano blockchain technology" and "Drivepadi: Building Decentralized car rentals platform on Cardano," as they focus on specific service industry solutions (car care and rentals) rather than the broader themes of empowerment, education, and financial inclusion.
