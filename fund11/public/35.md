# Group 35

## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of transparency, reliability, and accessibility in systems that are currently lacking in these areas. The proposals aim to address issues related to voting systems, political affiliation, and carbon markets by leveraging technology to improve auditability, trust, and participation.

Common keywords or concepts across these proposals include:
- Transparency
- Reliability
- Auditability
- Sovereignty over personal data
- Accessibility for participants
- Trust and credibility

The proposal titled "KWARXS - 'Fracturizing: Revolutionize, Evolve'" does not align with the main idea identified, as it focuses on expanding access to renewable energy assets for small-scale investors, which is a distinct issue from the transparency and reliability concerns present in the other proposals.
