## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of education through the integration of blockchain technology, specifically the Cardano blockchain. This is aimed at addressing various educational challenges such as limited access to quality resources, lack of awareness, and the need for modernization in the learning process. The proposals suggest leveraging blockchain to create more accessible, efficient, and personalized educational experiences.

Common keywords and concepts across the proposals include:
- Education
- Blockchain (specifically Cardano)
- Accessibility
- Personalization
- Awareness
- Technology Integration
- Decentralization

The proposal titled "Uber for Tutoring - Decentralised Tutor’s Marketplace (DirectEd)" does not explicitly mention the use of blockchain technology or the Cardano platform, focusing instead on the inefficiencies in the tutor market. This proposal stands out as it does not directly align with the main idea of integrating blockchain into education, although it does address educational improvement through a different approach.
