# Group 12

## Summary

The main idea common across the majority of these proposals is the enhancement of digital identity, security, and the integration of self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions within various ecosystems, particularly on the Cardano blockchain. These proposals aim to address challenges related to identity verification, authentication, and the management of digital credentials, often leveraging Atala PRISM as a foundational technology.

Common keywords and concepts across these proposals include:
- Digital Identity
- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
- Atala PRISM
- Security and Privacy
- Credential Management
- Decentralization
- Blockchain Integration
- Identity Wallets
- Verification and Authentication
- KYC (Know Your Customer) Compliance
- Threshold Signatures
- GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation)
- Open Source Development
- Smart Contracts and Escrow Services
- Educational Outreach and Adoption

One proposal that stands out as not directly related to the main idea is "BuildingOnCardano.dev v2," which focuses on improving a website's functionality rather than digital identity or SSI solutions. This proposal is concerned with making the website searchable, collaborative, and assisted by AI/GPT, which is a different focus compared to the other proposals listed.
