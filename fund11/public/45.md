The proposals aim to address the lack of blockchain knowledge and its potential applications in different regions and sectors, such as journalism, youth communities, businesses, and agriculture.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals:
- Blockchain education and awareness
- Cardano technology and its applications
- Financial inclusion and innovation

The proposal titled "Art Beyond Borders: NFT Global Youth Art Competition & Marketplace leveraging NMKR" does not explicitly mention the use of Cardano or blockchain education as its primary focus, but rather focuses on using technology to overcome barriers in the art community. This proposal stands out as it addresses a different problem and solution set compared to the others that are more directly focused on blockchain technology education and adoption.
