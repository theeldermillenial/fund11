## Summary

The main idea common across most of these proposals is the enhancement of data accessibility, transparency, and utility within the Cardano ecosystem. These proposals aim to address issues related to the availability of accurate, reliable, and real-time data for various stakeholders, including developers, analysts, and end-users. They seek to create solutions that provide better data infrastructure, oracle services, and reference data to support the ecosystem's growth and security.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals:
- Data transparency
- Real-time data access
- Oracle services
- Data infrastructure
- Stakeholder empowerment
- Cost efficiency
- Data accuracy and reliability
- Decentralized solutions
- Enhanced analytics and tools

All proposals except "AIBIS - ALL MARKET IN TOUCH" align with the main idea of improving data services within the Cardano ecosystem. The "AIBIS" proposal focuses on the inefficiency of data collection through survey campaigns, which is a distinct problem not directly related to the enhancement of data infrastructure or oracle services.
