## Summary

The main idea common across most of the proposals is the enhancement of open-source development, governance, and community collaboration through the creation or improvement of tools and platforms. These proposals focus on addressing challenges related to sustainable contributions, effective governance, decision-making, and the onboarding of new contributors.

Keywords or concepts common across the proposals include:
- Open-source development
- Governance
- Community collaboration
- Onboarding and education
- Contribution and financial support
- Tools and platforms

All proposals except "SWARM Treasury PBL" and "S3PBL: Practical learning opportunities for governance and decision-making" explicitly mention the need for better tools or platforms to support their respective areas. The "SWARM Treasury PBL" proposal focuses on the adoption and use of a treasury system for Web3 projects, which is a more specific application than the general tooling and platform development mentioned in the other proposals. The "S3PBL: Practical learning opportunities for governance and decision-making" proposal emphasizes the need for social practice to build communal habits for governance, which is a more process-oriented approach rather than a tool or platform solution.
